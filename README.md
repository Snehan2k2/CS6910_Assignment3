# CS6910_Assignment3

Use recurrent neural networks to build a character transliteration system. The goal of this assignment is fourfold: (i) learn how to model sequence to sequence learning problems using Recurrent Neural Networks (ii) compare different cells such as simple RNN, LSTM and GRU (iii) Usage of attention networks
